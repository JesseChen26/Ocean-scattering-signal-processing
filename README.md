# Ocean-scattering-signal-processing
This project focuses on the processing of seafloor scattering signals. The idea of processing is for the time period between the first seafloor reflection and the surface reflection to be processed as a seafloor scattering signal. The intensity of the signal received by the hydrophone is calculated.
